Done: 

so now - we just need to add some error handling, and perhaps the new route. ****;
1. add more fuzzing to hash. maybe based on the time string
get rid of the validation, perhaps add that 
2. integrate the functions to actually use the paired hash
3. color styling? or minor padding, etc. 

1. Deploy!!! 
1. Add a navBar

2. Add the functionality to lookup corresponding entries
3. Add info page
4. Add stylings
5. Add cookies to remember user; perhaps some way to lookup the entry? They just won't be able to lookup otherwise.
6. Need validation - that they can't submit more than 1 entry for the day . Disable this from frontend ?  Think about what other ways they can use other apps. Maybe oauth?

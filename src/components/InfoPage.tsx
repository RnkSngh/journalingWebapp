        What would it be like to live a day in the life of a stranger? Well you
        can find out here!
      </p>
      <h2> How does it work? </h2>

      <p>
        {" "}
        Each day, you can submit a journal entry here about how your day was.
        You can include anything you&apos;d like or make it as long or as short as
        you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day after you submit your entry, you will be paired up
        with a random person and be able to read their journal entry! Similarly,
        the same person will be able to read what you wrote! Both are anonymous
        - so you won&apos;t be able to tell who it was just based on the match (But
        maybe based on the content of your journal entry){" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        To make things interesting, I&apos;d recommend following the{" "}
        <a href="/"> guidelines for connecting with strangers</a>
      </p>

      <h2> Journal Entry writing Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          - Don&apos;t be afraid to be vulnerable! How are you feeling, what happened
          today that was noteworthy?
        </li>
        <li>
          - Try to keep it anonymous as possible! It&apos;s easier to do the above
          step when you are worrying less about who might read it.
        </li>

        <li>
          - If you run out of things to write about, or if you can&apos;t come up
          with anything noteable that happened, feel free to share a link (e.g.
          a video or song or post) that you&apos;ve enjoyed recently, or talk more
          generally about yourself (e.g. what do you like most about yourself)
          or about people you admire.
        </li>
      </ul>
